# Lightweight-Threshold-Implementations

2TI_Simon

2TI_Simon is a masked implementation of lightweight block cipher Simon and the masking scheme adopted is based on the state-of-the-art Threshold Implementation (TI) which is considered as an effective countermeasure againt glitches.

While regular TI requires at least 3 uniformly random shares to represent any secret value in order for first-order leakage resistance, 2TI_Simon is proposed as a preliminary attempt to use only 2 shares to reduce the resource usage while keep the same level of the security.

Correctness, Non-conpleteness and Uniformity, which are three key rules for a valid 3-share TI scheme, are still retained in 2-share TI to guanrantee the leakage resistance even in the presence of glitches.

Detailed description of the scheme can be found at https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/434.pdf.

About the RTL code
++ TI_Simon_Core.v

This file contains the RTL decription of the 2TI_Simon encryption core with key size and block size of 128 bits. The core is based on a bit-serilized implementations of Simon. https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/172.pdf.

The inputs are the bitstreams of shares of the plaintexts and keys. The outputs are ciphertext in bits and a 'Done' signal indicating the finish of the encryption. A 'Trig' signal is used for waveform measurement.

++ TI_Simon_Core_tb.v

This is the testbench to run behavioral simulation of the above 2TI_simon core. The plaintext is set as 63736564207372656c6c657661727420 while the key is 0f0e0d0c0b0a09080706050403020100. The correct ciphertext should be 49681b1e1e54fe3f65aa832af84e0bbc. Since the output ciphertext of the core is in binary format, you will need to verify the ciphertext manually bit by bit.

++ TI_Simon_TopModule.v

This file is actually a wrapper for the core to interface the external module such as the controller logic.

++ TI_Simon_TopModule_tb.v

The testbench code to simulate the behavior of the above module.

Usage of the core
The design is ported to Sasebo GII board for side-channel evaluation. It could be simply embedded into the Verilog codes provided by Sasebo project from http://satoh.cs.uec.ac.jp/SAKURA/hardware/SASEBO-GII.html.

One import modification of the control core is the random number generator in order for data sharing. We use a LFSR to implement this function while you can design you own randomness source as you want. But one may need to remember that the randomness source is better to be placed in the control core instead of the crypto core.
